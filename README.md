# StarTrailCombiner
A little app to combine all of images to just one beautiful Star Trail. 
I tried to keep it simple as possible. 

It was develop in QT with QtCreator IDE, mostly for learning Qt framework. 
Algorithm used for combining image is maxiumum. 

# Usage

In the app, we simply click open and load the photos.
